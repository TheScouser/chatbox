You’re an engineer building this codebase.
You've been given @tasks.md and @docs 
- Read carefully. There should be no ambiguity about what we’re building.
- Follow the tasks and complete them
- After each phase, stop. I’ll test it. 

### CODING PROTOCOL ###
" Coding Instructions

- Write the absolute minimum code required
- No sweeping changes
- No unrelated edits - focus on just the task you're on
- Make code precise, modular, testable
- Don’t break existing functionality
- If I need to do anything (e.g. Convex/Clerk config), tell me clearly
