# 4. Key Design Considerations

## 4.1. User Experience (UX) & User Interface (UI)

*   **Simplicity for Business Users:** The agent creation and management dashboard must be extremely intuitive. Users should be able to create and configure agents with minimal friction.
*   **Clear Onboarding:** Guide new users through the process of creating their first agent and adding data sources.
*   **Responsive Design:** The management dashboard and the embedded chat widget must be responsive and work well on various screen sizes.
*   **Chat Widget Clarity:** The end-user chat interface should be clean, easy to use, and clearly indicate that it's an AI.
*   **Performance:** Fast loading times for the dashboard and quick responses from the AI agent are crucial for good UX.

## 4.2. Scalability

*   **Agent Capacity:** The system should be designed to handle a large number of agents, each with potentially large knowledge bases.
*   **Concurrent Users:** Support many businesses managing their agents simultaneously and many end-users interacting with chat widgets.
*   **Data Ingestion:** The pipeline for processing uploaded documents and crawled web content needs to be scalable and efficient.
*   **LLM API Calls:** Manage API rate limits and costs associated with LLM interactions effectively.
*   **Database Performance:** Ensure database queries are optimized, especially for vector search in the knowledge base.

## 4.3. Security

*   **Data Isolation:** Ensure that each business user's data (agents, knowledge bases) is strictly isolated and cannot be accessed by others.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Robust mechanisms for user login and access control to different parts of the platform.
*   **Secure Iframe:** Implement security best practices for the iframe to prevent vulnerabilities like clickjacking. Use `Content-Security-Policy` headers.
*   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS and other injection attacks, both in the management dashboard and chat interface.
*   **API Security:** Secure backend APIs (e.g., using HTTPS, API keys/tokens for sensitive operations).
*   **Sensitive Data Handling:** If any personally identifiable information (PII) is processed or stored, ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   **Protection against Misuse:** Consider safeguards to prevent the platform from being used for malicious purposes (e.g., creating spam bots).

## 4.4. Maintainability & Extensibility

*   **Modular Codebase:** Well-structured code with clear separation of concerns to facilitate easier updates and bug fixes.
*   **Automated Testing:** Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure reliability.
*   **Logging & Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring to track system health, identify issues, and understand usage patterns.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date internal documentation for developers.
*   **Future-Proofing:** Design the system with flexibility to integrate new AI models, data source types, or features in the future.

## 4.5. Agent Performance & Accuracy

*   **Relevance of Information:** Focus on retrieving the most relevant context for the LLM to generate accurate answers.
*   **Handling Ambiguity:** Strategies for how the agent should respond when queries are unclear or outside its knowledge base.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Careful design of prompts sent to the LLM to guide its responses effectively.
*   **Feedback Mechanism (Future):** Consider allowing business users to provide feedback on agent responses to help fine-tune or identify areas for knowledge base improvement.
